Pros of this approach are that we are way more flexible than traditional studios with fixed members and we can operate globally and build an extensive network. Freelancers can also work on other projects if they wish since they are not bounded by contracts. Cons are that collaborations between freelancers will take extra coordination.",
	"happy_formal_vole_laugh": "What is the trade-off of paying a cheaper price?",
	"aqua_weak_racoon_propel": "Since we are operating globally and we want to simplify the pricing, we set the same price for all regions which is why it seems ridiculously cheap when you are from United States or European countries. Also, we do not handle company branding nor designing from scratch since we want to control costs. We believe using existing designs for reference works 99% of the time and there is almost always a design that fits your business needs. Lastly, we are a growing studio and our aim is to build connections. We don't expect to make lots of profit in early stages and we want to provide quality services at an affordable price.",
	"gross_misty_giraffe_trim": "How is Stable Studio different from other studios?",
	"ok_dirty_meerkat_arise": "We do not charge until the website's design and features have been confirmed since we do not design from scratch. We also allow you to choose your preferred way of deployment or hosting if you so desire since it becomes a big deal when the website is a e-commerce platform or Saas. Lastly, we offer free consultations for small and medium sized businesses to help you avoid spending unnecessary money and choosing the right tech stack. Don't fret even if you know nothing about tech. We all start from zero at some point.",
	"ornate_equal_wombat_imagine": "What should I pay attention to before purchasing services form Stable Studio?",
	"true_stale_macaw_pride": "The crucial details are outlined in the process section. You need to think about what features your websites need: maybe a gallery for photos, a section for testimonials or something unique like interactive playground. We give advices but the ultimate decision lies in your hand. For SEO, relying on on-page optimization alone has limited effects on how well your ranking can improve in search results. Our suggestion is to let us know which feature you think is quite unique in the market and would like us to stress about, then combine both on & off-page optimizations to get the optimal results. For one-off plans, you need to pay 50% up-front and then the remaining 50% after project is finished. We accept credit cards, Alipay, Apple & Google Pay, etc. for payment methods.",
	"lost_north_earthworm_tap": "Can the website be updated after the project is finished?",
	"brief_fun_herring_pull": "For one-off plans, you get three revisions after the website is deployed. Any further revisions require extra fees. In most scenarios it would be a minimal fee of $10 but updates with layout changes or new animations will cost more. For monthly subscriptions, you enjoy the privilege of having unlimited revisions. However, the tech stack the website is build with cannot be changed since it will be too costly.",
